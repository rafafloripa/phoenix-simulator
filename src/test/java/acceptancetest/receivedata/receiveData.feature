Feature: subscribing for a signal
  As a developer
  I want to subscribe for a specific signal
  So that I can use it in my application

  @shutdownNode
  Scenario: subscribing for a signal
    Given The dummy server is setup
    And The simulator is setup
    And After 2000 mSec have passed
    And Add a node to simulator on port 8251 and ip localhost
    And After 2000 mSec have passed
    And The simulator is ready to receive data from address localhost and port 8251
    And After 2000 mSec have passed
    And The dummy server sends the signal 320 with the value 10 as a float
    And After 2000 mSec have passed
    Then The simulator should have received 10 from signal id 320 as a float
